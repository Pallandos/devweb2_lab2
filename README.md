### Activity 1

In the **V2** type we mask some fields, because we might have differents clients accessing our API. For example customers VS employees...

### Activity 2

I added a `POST` endpoint to the *classic* API (v1).

### Activity 3

I created herlper function to handle the file reading and made the requests function to use the file handler. Now all data is stored inside a `products.json` database.
